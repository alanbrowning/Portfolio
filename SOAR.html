             This project was completed as a part of the Society of Astronautics and Rocketry (SOAR) at the University of Pittsburgh. SOAR is a student organization that competes in the annual NASA university student launch initiative (USLI). The goal of the project was to design, manufacture, and launch a model rocket based on NASA guidelines. This project required the design and manufacturing of 2 rockets (a full and sub-scale), as well as 3 design reports.
             <br><br>
             The NASA student launch initiative is an annual challenge given to students at universities nation-wide. The challenge requires the creation of a model rocket to be launch based on a few standards. This year, the challenge was to peak at a target apogee and release a payload upon decent. This payload would be responsible for taking a 360 degree panoramic photograph. This project consisted of many systems which worked together to complete the goal. My work was focused on the mechanical sub-team. This group was responsible for designing the rocket's airframe, fins, and propulsion systems.
             <br><br>
             To design the rocket, quite a few factors had to be considered. First and most importantly, the rocket had to be safe. This meant we had to conduct a failure mode and effect analysis on nearly all of the components. Second, the rocket had to hit near the target apogee. Based off of last years rocket and computer simulations, we had a rough estimate of weights and drag coefficients. Using this knowledge, we could predict generally what our design would need to be.
             <br><br>
             The first portion of design that I worked on was the airframe. Based on previous years, we decided to use fiberglass as it was fairly lightweight and strong. Additionally, I decided that the nosecone should be Von-Karman, as it is typically the best for performance and is fairly accessible. The fins were decided to be clipped delta, due to its aerodynamics and easy manufacturability. All of these choices were made as a team. To aid in the decision, we created decision matrices, which outlined the pros/cons of each choice. The categories for the matrices were weighted differently based on the importance to the flight.
             <br><br>
             To choose a motor, we first had to simulate the rockets performance via OpenRocket. Based on the airframe design and weight estimates, we could determine motors that would successfully help the rocket reach apogee. Based off of those selections, we choose a motor that was approved by NASA and fit out rocket's dimensions. Further analysis such as FEA simulations were conducted to ensure components would not exceed yield stresses during takeoff. Additional work was conducted by other sub-groups to complete the design. This work contains but is not limited to: avionics, recovery, and payload.
             <br><br>
             All of this design work culminated in a successful manufacturing of two rockets. The first (sub-scale) rocket was launched as a means to test how our design would work. This launch served as a way to see if there were any glaring oversights in the design. It did not contain all components (such as the payload, electronics, etc), but we used ballasts to simulate their weight. After this successful launch, the full-scale was produced, which will be launched this spring (2021). To accompany these launches, we were also evaluated on the design reports/presentations. Three detailed design reviews were completed (PDR, CDR, FRR) and presented to NASA engineers.
